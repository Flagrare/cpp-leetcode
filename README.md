# LeetCode C++ Solutions

## 🚀 Plan and Motivation

My goal is to become a professional game programmer by deeply understanding how games work at a foundational level. Rather than relying solely on existing game engines, I want to master core principles—including algorithms, data structures, and low-level C++ concepts—to build a versatile and robust skill set.

As part of this learning journey, I'm developing a simple game engine (in a separate repository) to strengthen my foundational knowledge. Simultaneously, I am solving algorithmic and data structure problems on LeetCode in modern C++, aiming to establish the technical skills essential for high-performance game programming.

**In summary**: This repository reflects my dedication to mastering modern C++ and problem-solving as key components of my path toward professional game development.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each LeetCode problem is organized in its own directory:

```text
leetcode/
├── 001-two-sum/
│   └── two-sum.cpp
├── 002-add-two-numbers/
│   └── add-two-numbers.cpp
```

**Each solution includes:**

* `.cpp` file with clear, well-documented code
* Time and space complexity notes (as comments, where relevant)

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

* **Language:** C++
* **Platform:** LeetCode (web-based IDE for most submissions)
* **Editor/IDE:** VS Code / CLion *(for local runs)*
* **Build System:** CMake *(if needed)*
